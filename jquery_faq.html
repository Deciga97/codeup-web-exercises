    <dt>What is a national park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">A national park is a protected area of land in the United States that is managed by the National Park Service. It is set aside for the enjoyment of the public, and for the preservation of the natural, cultural, and recreational resources found there.</dd>
    <dt>What is the difference between a national park and a state park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">National parks are managed by the federal government, while state parks are managed by state governments. National parks tend to be larger and have more diverse natural and cultural resources, while state parks are usually smaller and may focus more on recreational activities. Both types of parks are protected areas, but national parks have stricter regulations on development and resource use.</dd>
    <dt>What activities can I do in a national park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">National parks offer a variety of activities, including hiking, camping, fishing, birdwatching, and sightseeing. Some parks also have historical or cultural sites to visit, such as museums, fortifications, or ruins. Some parks offer more specialized activities, such as rock climbing, rafting, or horseback riding.</dd>
    <dt>Are national parks free to visit?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Most national parks have an entrance fee, which helps to fund the park's operations and maintenance. However, there are some free days throughout the year when the entrance fee is waived. Additionally, there are programs available to provide free access to national parks for military members, fourth graders, and people with disabilities.</dd>
    <dt>Where can I find a list of national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">There are currently 60 national parks in the United States. You can find a list of all the national parks, along with information about each park, on the National Park Service's website at www.nps.gov/
